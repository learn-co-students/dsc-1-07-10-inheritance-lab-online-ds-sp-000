    "# Inheritance - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use what we've learned about inheritance to model a zoo using superclasses, subclasses, and maybe even an abstract superclass!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use inheritance to to write D.R.Y. code\n",
    "* Understand the relationship between subclasses and superclasses\n",
    "* Create Object-Oriented data models that describe the real world with classes and subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling a Zoo\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:  You've been hired by a zookeeper to build a program that keeps track of all the animals in the zoo.  This is a great opportunity to make use of Inheritance and Object-Oriented Programming!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an Abstract Superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating an abstract superclass, `Animal`.  When our program is complete, all subclasses of `Animal` will have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name`, which is a string set at instantation time\n",
    "* `size`, which can be `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'`, or `'enormous'`.\n",
    "* `weight`, which is an integer set at integer set at instantiation time.\n",
    "* `species`, a string that tells us the species of the animal\n",
    "* `food_type`, which can be `'herbivore'`, `'carnivore'`, or `'omnivore'`\n",
    "* `nocturnal`, a boolean value that is `True` if the animal sleeps during the day, otherwise `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll also have the following behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sleep`, which prints a string saying if the animal sleeps during day or night\n",
    "* `eat`, which takes in the string `plants` or `meat`, and returns `'{animal name} the {animal species} thinks {food} is yummy!'` or `'I don't eat this!'` based on the animal's `food_type` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, create an abstract superclass that meets these specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** For some attributes in an abstract superclass such as `size`, the initial value doesn't matter--just make sure that you remember to override it in each of the subclasses!"
